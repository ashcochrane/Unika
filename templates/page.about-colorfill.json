ColorFill was first brought into Europe with Formica in 1990 and was demonstrated to the trade on their exhibition stand at KBB Alexandra Palace.</p><p>The initial feedback couldn’t have been better and the founder of Unika Paul Rogers seized the opportunity and set up a company in Glasgow Scotland to market the worktop joint sealant products.</p><p></p>",
